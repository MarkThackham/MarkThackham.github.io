## Data
The [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand) contains hourly counts of bike rentals in Seoul across a full year, along with weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, dew point, solar radiation, rainfall, snowfall), temporal features (hour, date, season), and holiday / functional day indicators. Features can be used to predict the number of bikes rented in a given hour, based on both environmental and calendar variables. The dataset contains 8,760 examples and 13 features (units in brackets):

1. **Date** (Date)
2. **Rented Bike** (Integer)
3. **Hour** (Integer)
4. **Temperature** (C)
5. **Humidity** (%)
6. **Wind speed** (m/s)
7. **Visibility** (10m)
8. **Dew point temperature** (C)
9. **Solar Radiation**	(Mj/m2)
10. **Rainfall** (mm)
11. **Snowfall** (cm)
12. **Seasons**	(Categorical)
13. **Holiday**	(Binary)
14. **Functioning Day**	(Binary)

## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Response Variable
The response variable is the number of bikes rented in a given hour. The histogram below shows the distribution of bike rentals, with an overlaid density estimate. The distribution of bike rentals is right-skewed, with most hours having low to moderate rentals, and a few hours with very high rentals.

The plot below looks at a single month (September) shows the daily rental patterns more clearly, with consistent repetitive peaks.

Finally, the plot below looks at the first 7 days of September 2018.  Saturday and Sunday have a single peak while weekdays have two peaks, one in the morning and one in the evening, likely corresponding to commuting patterns.
