## Data
The [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand) contains hourly counts of bike rentals in Seoul across a full year, along with weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, dew point, solar radiation, rainfall, snowfall), temporal features (hour, date, season), and holiday / functional day indicators. It can be used to predict the number of bikes rented in a given hour, based on both environmental and calendar variables. The dataset contains 8,760 examples and 13 features (units in brackets):

1. **Date** (Date)
2. **Rented Bike** (Integer)
3. **Hour** (Integer)
4. **Temperature** (C)
5. **Humidity** (%)
6. **Wind speed** (m/s)
7. **Visibility** (10m)
8. **Dew point temperature** (C)
9. **Solar Radiation**	(Mj/m2)
10. **Rainfall** (mm)
11. **Snowfall** (cm)
12. **Seasons**	(Categorical)
13. **Holiday**	(Binary)
14. **Functioning Day**	(Binary)

## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Response Variable
The response variable is the number of bikes rented in a given hour. The plot below shows the hourly rental counts across the entire year, with clear daily and seasonal patterns.

There are peaks in the morning and evening corresponding to commuting times, as well as higher overall rentals in warmer months.

Looking at a single month (September) shows the daily rental patterns more clearly, with consistent morning and evening peaks.
